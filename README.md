# Title: python-tombo-book-downloader

# Description
  There is a public Portuguese public library called Tower of Tombo. 
In This library there are book I need to have acess. Lucky me, so of them are available online. 
As soon as the hand written books get scaned and uploaded by the Tombo people, they are available for me to get them easily with python. 

Python (the programming language) is helping me downloading each one. 
Python scrapes the webpage and automates the process of downloading each page into a specific directory. 
The goal of this software is downloading each page automatically instead manually
